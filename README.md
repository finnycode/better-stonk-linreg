# better-stonk-linreg
Makes a linear regression model for any stock
main.py works by calculating a linear regression model from your ticker input and does not use the files "values.txt" or "stock_list.csv".

custom_reg.py works by calculating a linear regression model from the "stock_list.csv" file and writing the data into the "values.txt" file. it uses both of
those files and is recommended that you put these three files in a seperate folder from "main.py"
